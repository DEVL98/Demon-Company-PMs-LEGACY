# Demon-Company-PMs-LEGACY
Old Demon Company PMs. Really old and really bad compared to what I have cooking.

Some of the operator descriptions are in the autorun lua, but I can add some dev notes here.

The project originated with Munch, I suppose. He had heard of my guns and asked me if he could make me a custom model. I had no idea what to make, so I decided that we could try making Demon 0-2 as a way to pass the time. Started off with the body of MW19 Roze's "Virago" skin, and I later confessed to having him make a rough draft of a character I'd thought up a couple years ago. He groaned and complained that I'd tricked him but still reluctantly agreed to help make the other playermodels.
